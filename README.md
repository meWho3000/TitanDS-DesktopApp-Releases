# Titan.DS - Desktop App (early test)

Here is the desktop version of the Titan.DS website [www.mewho.com/titan]! The content of the app is self-contained, **no internet connection required**.
Right click on the app window to access options from the popup context menu.
Keyboard shortcuts from Titan.DS website should all work in the desktop app version. (F:fullscreen, M:mute, etc.)

**Please Note:** This is an early test release, and some features are still under development. Your feedback is greatly appreciated as I work out the bugs towards a stable release.



## Security Warning (Unsigned Application)

Because this app is not currently code-signed, you may encounter security warnings when you download and try to run it. This is a standard security measure implemented by the operating systems to protect users from potentially malicious software.

Due to the cost of certification, I cannot promise that future releases will have code signing certificates to eliminate these warnings.




## To Be Fixed, Missing Features

*   The following two modules will not work since they directly link to my two other online projects. In future release, these two module *might* require an internet connection.
    *   APOD Stardate module
    *   Stellar Cartography module

*   When toggling the window title bar, this results a reload on the LCARS content. Still searching a solution to prevent this.
*   Current the window title bar style status (show/hide) is not saved.
*   Might add an option to spawn a second window.

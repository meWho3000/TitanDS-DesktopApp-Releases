# Titan.DS - Desktop App (early test)

Here is the desktop version of the Titan.DS website [www.mewho.com/titan]! The content of the app is self-contained, **no internet connection requiredâ€¢â€¢.
Right click on the app window to access options from the popup context menu.
Keyboard shortcuts from Titan.DS website should all work in the desktop app version.

**Please Note:** This is a early test release, and some features are still under development. Your feedback is greatly appreciated as I work out the bugs towards a stable release.

# Titan.DS ‚Ä¢ Desktop App (early test) :: 2024.DEC.28

Here is the desktop version of the Titan.DS website [www.mewho.com/titan]! The content of the app is self-contained, **no internet connection required**.
Right click on the app window to access options from the popup context menu.
Keyboard shortcuts from Titan.DS website should all work in the desktop app version. (F:fullscreen, M:mute, arrow keys, etc.)

**Please Note:** This is an EARLY TEST RELEASE, and some features are still under development. Your feedback is greatly appreciated as I work out the bugs towards a stable release.

## Security Warning (Unsigned Application)

Because this app is not currently code-signed, you may encounter security and/or anti-virus warnings when you download and try to run it. This is a standard security measure implemented by modern operating systems to protect users from potentially malicious software. You can look up online resources or guides for temporarily bypassing or disabling such warnings if necessary.

\* Due to the cost of certification, I cannot promise that future releases will have code signing implementation to eliminate these warnings.

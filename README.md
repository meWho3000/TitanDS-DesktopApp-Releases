# Titan.DS ‚Ä¢ Desktop App (v0.5.0 beta, updated 2025.Jan.16)

Here is the desktop version of the Titan.DS website [https://www.mewho.com/titan], packaged by using Electron framework. The content of the app is self-contained, **no internet connection required**.
Right click on the app window to access options from the popup context menu.


## Security Warning (Unsigned Application)

Since this app isn't code-signed, you may see security or anti-virus warnings when downloading and running it. This is a standard security measure in modern operating systems to protect users from potentially malicious software. You can look up online resources or guides for temporarily bypassing or disabling such warnings if necessary. **Mac users**, please read the additional instructions on the release page.

\* Due to the cost of certification, I cannot promise that future releases will have code signing implementation to eliminate these warnings.
